## About
HaverokFM is an internet radio made from random friends' playlists. I hope you enjoy it, but there are a lot of bugs — I am working on it sometimes.

## Features
- it works, mostly  
- portrait/mobile support  
- mostly stable on bad internet, like on road trips

## Updates
- new reconnecting algorithm (reloads the whole audio stream instead of trying to fix it)  
- new web design and also a WIP (work in progress) version; the About section is available — feel free to try it
